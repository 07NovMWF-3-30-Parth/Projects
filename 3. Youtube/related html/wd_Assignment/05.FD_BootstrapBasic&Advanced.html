                <p>Bootstrap Containers are the most basic layout element in Bootstrap. Bootstrap Containers are very
                    essential and basic building blocks of bootstrap that wrap a page’s content. It’s responsible for
                    setting and aligning content within it according to viewport or given device. Containers are defined
                    within the container class (.container).</p>
                <p>In other words, we can say that containers are established the width for the layout to give the
                    content. Elements and content are added within the container.</p>
                <p>
                    Containers are used to contain, pad, and (sometimes) center the content within them. While
                    containers can be nested, most layouts do not require a nested container.
                    <br>
                    Basically, there are three types of container classes available in bootstrap:
                <dl>
                    <dt><u>Default-Container(container)</u></dt>
                    <dd>The default container uses ‘.container’ class. It provides a responsive fixed-width container.
                    </dd>
                    <br>
                    <dt><u>Responsive-Container(along with sm, md, lg, xl, xxl)</u></dt>
                    <dd>Responsive containers are responsive in nature. Responsive containers allow you to specify a
                        class that is wide until the specified breakpoint is reached, after which we apply max-widths
                        for each of the higher breakpoints.</dd>
                    <br>
                    <dt><u>Fluid-Container(container-fluid)</u></dt>
                    <dd>Fluid-container uses the ‘.container-fluid’ class. It is used for a full-width container,
                        spanning the entire width of the viewport.</dd>
                </dl>
                </p>

                <p>Bootstrap 5 uses a default font-size of 1rem (16px by default), and its line-height is 1.5. In
                    addition, all &lt; p &gt; elements have margin-top: 0 and margin-bottom: 1rem (16px by default).</p>
            </div>
            <div id="que4" class="bg-primary bg-gradient mb-4 p-3">
                <h2 class="text-center bg-info bg-gradient">4. What do you know about the Bootstrap Grid System?</h2>
                <p>Bootstrap’s grid system uses a series of containers, rows, and columns to layout and align content.
                    It’s built with flexbox and is fully responsive.</p>
                <p>It is a powerful mobile-first flexbox grid to build layouts of all shapes and sizes thanks to a
                    <u>twelve column system</u>, <u>six default responsive tiers</u>, <u>Sass variables and mixins</u>,
                    and <u>dozens of predefined classes</u>.
                </p>
                <p>There are 6 classes in Bootstrap 5 grid system.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>.col- (extra small devices - screen width less than 576px)</li>
                    <li>.col-sm- (small devices - screen width equal to or greater than 576px)</li>
                    <li>.col-md- (medium devices - screen width equal to or greater than 768px)</li>
                    <li>.col-lg- (large devices - screen width equal to or greater than 992px)</li>
                    <li>.col-xl- (extra large devices - screen width equal to or greater than 1200px)</li>
                    <li>.col-xxl- (extra extra large devices - screen width equal to or greater than 1400px)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>You can also combine the above classes to create more dynamic and flexible layouts.</p>

                <p>To create thumbnails using Bootstrap −
                <ul>
                    <li>Add an &lt; a &gt; tag with the class of .thumbnail around an image.</li>
                    <li>This adds four pixels of padding and a gray border.</li>
                    <li>On hover, an animated glow outlines the image.</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <br>
                <p><u>If you want to add custom content</u><br><br>Now that we have a basic thumbnail, it's possible to
                    add any kind of HTML content like headings, paragraphs, or buttons into thumbnails. Follow the steps
                    below −
                <ul>
                    <li>Change the &lt; a &gt; tag that has a class of .thumbnail to a &lt; div &gt;.</li>
                    <li>Inside of that &lt; div &gt;, you can add anything you need. As this is a &lt; div &gt;, we can
                        use the default span-based naming convention for sizing.</li>
                    <li>If you want to group multiple images, place them in an unordered list, and each list item will
                        be floated to the left.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>In Bootstrap 4, flex box is used to control the layout and alignment specification of Bootstrap 4
                    components. This box makes it easier to design flexible responsive layout structures without using
                    float or positioning attributes.</p>
                <p>Flex utility can be used to manage the layout, alignment, grid columns, navigation and other
                    components of the page. It makes easy to design layout structure without using float or positioning.

                <p>Flex Behaviors and Direction</p>
                <p>Use the flexbox display utilities like d-flex and d-inline-flex to display the flexbox container and
                    children elements into flex items. You can set the direction of flex items in horizontal direction
                    and vertical direction by using .flex-row (use .flex-row-reverse to display horizontal direction
                    from the opposite side) and .flex-column (use .flex-column-reverse to display vertical direction
                    from the opposite side) classes.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Justify Content :- (such as start, end, center, between and around)</li>
                    <li>Align Items :- (such as start, end, center, baseline and stretch)</li>
                    <li>Fill, Grow and Shrink :- .flex-fill, .flex-grow-* & .flex-shrink</li>
                    <li>Auto Margins and With align-items :- .mr-auto (pushes items to the right) and .ml-auto (pushes
                        items to the left) classes. The flex items can be moved to top or bottom by using mt-auto or
                        mb-auto classes on a container.</li>
                    <li>Order :- The flex uses order utilities to change the order of flex items in a container.</li>
                    <li>Align Content :- (such as start, end, center, between and around)</li>

                <p>Bootstrap provides an easy way to create a stylized alert message box with its alert component. To create an alert box, use the .alert class along with one of the . alert-* classes to specify the kind of alert. <br> It has eight classes to specify that kind of alert.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>alert-primary</li>
                    <li>alert-secondary</li>
                    <li>alert-success</li>
                    <li>alert-danger</li>
                    <li>alert-warning</li>
                    <li>alert-info</li>
                    <li>alert-light</li>
                    <li>alert-dark</li>
                </ul>
                <ol>
                    <li>Use the .alert-link utility class to quickly provide matching colored links within any alert. </li>
                    <li>Alerts can also contain additional HTML elements like headings, paragraphs and dividers. </li>
                    <li>Similarly, you can use flexbox utilities and Bootstrap Icons to create alerts with icons. Depending on your icons and content, you may want to add more utilities or custom styles.</li>
                </ol>

                <p>A bootstrap card is a flexible and extensible content container. It includes options for headers and footers, a wide variety of content, contextual background colors, and powerful display options.</p>
                <p>cards are built with as little markup and styles as possible, but still manage to deliver a ton of control and customization. Built with flexbox, they offer easy alignment and mix well with other Bootstrap components. They have no margin by default, so use spacing utilities as needed.</p>
                <p>Cards support a wide variety of content, including images, text, list groups, links, and more.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The building block of a card is the .card-body.</li>
                    <li>Card titles are used by adding .card-title to a &lt; h* &gt; tag.</li>
                    <li>links are added by adding .card-link to an &lt; a &gt; tag.</li>
                    <li>Subtitles are used by adding a .card-subtitle to a &lt; h* &gt; tag.</li>
                    <li>.card-img-top places an image to the top of the card.</li>
                    <li>.card-text, text can be added to the card.</li>
                    <li>Cards include various options for customizing their backgrounds, borders, and color.</li>
                    <li>Use the Bootstrap grid system and its .row-cols classes to control how many grid columns (wrapped around your cards) you show per row.</li>
