                <h2>1. What is JavaScript?</h2>
                <p>JavaScript is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control
                    multimedia, animate images, and pretty much everything else.</p>
                <p>In simple words,</p>
                <p>JavaScript is a text-based programming language used both on the client-side and server-side that
                    allows you to make web pages interactive. Where HTML and CSS are languages that give structure and
                    style to web pages, JavaScript gives web pages interactive elements that engage a user.</p>

                <h2>2. What is the use of isNaN function?</h2>
                <p>In Javascript isNaN() function is used to check if any value is NaN (which stands for 'Not-a-Number')
                    or not. If the value passed is NaN, the function returns true else, it returns false.</p>
                <p>isNaN() is a function property of the global object.</p>

                <h2>3. What is negative Infinity?</h2>
                <p>In JavaScript there is a concept called negative infinity, which is less than any real number.</p>
                <p>The symbol “-∞” is used to denote negative infinity. <br>It is an infinitely long zip line in
                    opposite directions.</p>
                <p>Number. NEGATIVE_INFINITY returns negative infinity.<br>Number. NEGATIVE_INFINITY is "a number lower
                    than any other number".</p>

                <p>Netscape and Eich designed JavaScript as a scripting language for use with the company's flagship web
                    browser, Netscape Navigator. <br>Initially known as LiveScript, Netscape changed the name to

                <p>There is two ways we can change the style/class of an element in JavaScript.</p>
                <p>method 1 : Changing CSS with the help of the style property:<br><b>Syntax :
                        document.getElementById("id").style.property = new_style</b></p>
                <p>method 2 : Changing the class itself – We can use two properties that can be used to manipulate the
                    classes.
                <blockquote>
                    1. The classList Property: The classList is a read-only property that returns the CSS class names of
                    an element as a DOMTokenList object.<br><b>Syntax : document.getElementById("id").classList</b>
                    <br>
                    <blockquote>You can use the below-mentioned methods to add classes, remove classes, and toggle
                        between different
                        classes respectively.
                        <br><br>
                        1. The add() method: It adds one or more classes.<br>
                        2. The remove() method: It removes one or more classes.<br>
                        3. The toggle() method: If the class does not exist it adds it and returns true. It removes the
                        class and returns false. The second boolean argument forces the class to be added or removed.
                    </blockquote>
                </blockquote>
                <blockquote>

                    2. The className Property: This property is used to set the current class of the element to the
                    specified class.<br><b>Syntax : document.getElementById("id").className = class</b>

                <p>The JavaScript loops are used to iterate the piece of code using for, while, do while or for-in

                    Following is the syntax that a user may use to convert a string into an integer value (of any base)
                    <br>
                    <b>Syntax : parseInt(string_value, base)</b>
                    <br><br>
                    Alternatively, if we don’t want to specify the base value and just want to convert our string value
                    into an integer value itself, then we may use the following syntax also
                    <br>
                    <b>Syntax : parseInt(string_value)</b>

                <h2>13. What is the function of the delete operator?</h2>
                <p>The function of delete operator is to set the value of an object property to null or undefined. But the property will still exist in the object and some operators like for in loop will still show the presence of the null or undefined property.</p>
                <p>Using the delete property in loops slows down the program significantly. So, this method should only be used when it is absolutely necessary to delete an object property.</p>
                <p>
                    The delete operator doesn’t work for variables or function, it returns false and the actual variables and functions remain untouched.
                    <br>
                    Another thing to keep in mind is that this operator doesn’t delete property value rather the property itself.
                </p>
                <p>So, using pop(), shift(), or splice() methods is clearly a better approach to deleting array elements.</p>

                <p>There are three types of pop-up boxes available in JavaScript namely Alert Box, Confirm Box and Prompt Box.</p>
                <p>
                    <b><u>Alert Box :</u></b> It is used when a warning message is needed to be produced. When the alert
                    box is displayed to the user, the user needs to press ok and proceed.
                    <br>
                    <b>Syntax :- alert("your Alert here")</b>

                <p>
                    <b><u>Prompt Box :</u></b> It is a type of pop up box which is used to get the user input for
                    further use. After entering the required details user have to click ok to proceed next stage else by
                    pressing the cancel button user returns the null value.
                    <br>
                    <b>Syntax :- prompt("your Prompt here")</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b><u>Confirm Box :</u></b> It is a type of pop-up box that is used to get authorization or
                    permission from the
                    user. The user has to press the ok or cancel button to proceed.

                <h2>15. What is the use of Void (0)?</h2>
                <p>
                    JavaScript void 0 means returning undefined (void) as a primitive value. You might come across the term “JavaScript:void(0)” while going through HTML documents. It is used to prevent any side effects caused while inserting an expression in a web page.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Example :- Using “javascript:void(0);” in anchor tag:</b> Writing “javascript:void(0);” in anchor tag can prevent the page to reload and JavaScript functions & can be called on single or double clicks easily.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, in the old browsers which run ES3 engine, undefined is a global property and can be changed. On the other hand, it's not possible to override the void operator. Hence, void is used as a replacement for undefined to get the undefined value in a safe way.

                <p>If you use innerHTML in JavaScript, the disadvantage is</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Content is replaced everywhere</li>
                    <li>We cannot use it like “appending to innerHTML</li>
                    <li>Even if you use += like “innerHTML = innerHTML + ‘html'” still the old content is replaced by
                        html</li>
                    <li>The entire innerHTML content is re-parsed and builds into elements. Therefore, it’s much slower
                    </li>
                    <li>The innerHTML does not provide validation, and therefore we can potentially insert valid and
                        broken HTML in the document and break it</li>
